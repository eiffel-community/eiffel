# The Meta Object
The __meta__ object contains meta-information describing the event: when it was created, where it came from, its type et cetera. The __meta__ object contains the same members regardless of __meta.type__<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup>, with the caveat that certain members are optional and the tendency to use them may vary with event type.

Even though the meta object is kept universal for all event types (i.e. all events in an edition share the same version of a meta-object, it may change over time as the Eiffel protocol evolves. Due to the [per-event versioning](./versioning.md) of the protocol, this means that different unique combinations of event type, version and meta object version may feature different meta object syntax.

## Meta Members

### meta.id
__Type:__ String  
__Format:__ [UUID](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122)  
__Required:__ Yes  
__Description:__ The unique identity of the event, generated at event creation.

### meta.type
__Type:__ String  
__Format:__ An event type name  
__Required:__ Yes  
__Description:__ The type of event. This field is required by the recipient of the event, as each event type has a specific meaning and a specific set of members in the __data__ and __links__ objects.

### meta.version
__Type:__ String  
__Format:__ [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)  
__Required:__ Yes  
__Description:__ The version of the event type. This field is required by the recipient of the event to interpret the contents. Please see [Versioning](../eiffel-syntax-and-usage/versioning.md) for more information.

### meta.time
__Type:__ Integer  
__Format:__ UNIX Epoch time, in milliseconds.  
__Required:__ Yes  
__Description:__ The event creation timestamp.

### meta.tags
__Type:__ String[]  
__Format:__ Free text  
__Required:__ No  
__Description:__ Any tags or keywords associated with the events, for searchability purposes.

### meta.source
__Type:__ Object  
__Format:__  
__Required:__ No  
__Description:__ A description of the source of the event. This object is primarily for traceability purposes, and while optional, some form of identification of the source is __HIGHLY RECOMMENDED__. It offers multiple methods of identifying the source of the event, techniques which may be select from based on the technology domain and needs in any particular use case.

#### meta.source.domainId
__Type:__ String  
__Format:__ Free text  
__Required:__ No  
__Description:__ Identifies the [domain](../eiffel-syntax-and-usage/glossary.md#domain) that produced an event.

#### meta.source.host
__Type:__ String  
__Format:__ Hostname  
__Required:__ No  
__Description:__ The hostname of the event sender.

#### meta.source.name
__Type:__ String  
__Format:__ Free text  
__Required:__ No  
__Description:__ The name of the event sender.

#### meta.source.serializer
__Type:__ String  
__Format:__ [purl specification](https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec)  
__Required:__ No  
__Description:__ The identity of the serializer software used to construct the event, in [purl format](https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec).

#### meta.source.uri
__Type:__ String  
__Format:__ URI  
__Required:__ No  
__Description:__ The URI of, related to or describing the event sender.

### meta.security
__Type:__ Object  
__Format:__  
__Required:__ No  
__Description:__ An optional object for enclosing security related information, particularly supporting data integrity. See [Security](../eiffel-syntax-and-usage/security.md) for further information.

#### meta.security.authorIdentity
__Type:__ String  
__Format:__ [Distinguished Name](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2253)  
__Required:__ Yes  
__Description:__ The identity of the author of the event. This property is intended to enable the recipient to identify the author of the event contents and/or look up the appropriate public key for decrypting the __meta.security.integrityProtection.signature__ value and thereby verifying author identity and data integrity.

#### meta.security.integrityProtection
__Type:__ Object  
__Format:__  
__Required:__ No  
__Description:__ An optional object for enabling information integrity protection via cryptographic signing. To generate a correct __meta.security.integrityProtection__ object:
1. Generate the entire event, but with the __meta.security.integrityProtection.signature__ value set to an empty string.
1. Serialize the event on [Canonical JSON Form](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-staykov-hu-json-canonical-form-00).
1. Generate the signature using the __meta.security.integrityProtection.alg__ algorithm.
1. Set the __meta.security.integrityProtection.signature__ value to the resulting signature while maintaining Canonical JSON Form.
To verify the integrity of the event, the consumer then resets __meta.security.integrityProtection.signature__ to an empty string and ensures Canonical JSON Form before verifying the signature.

##### meta.security.integrityProtection.alg
__Type:__ String  
__Format:__ [A valid JWA RFC 7518 alg parameter value](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7518#section-3.1), excluding "none"  
__Required:__ Yes  
__Description:__ The cryptographic algorithm used to digitally sign the event. If no signing is performed, the __meta.security.integrityProtection__ SHALL be omitted rather than setting __meta.security.integrityProtection.alg__ to "none".

##### meta.security.integrityProtection.signature
__Type:__ String  
__Format:__  
__Required:__ Yes  
__Description:__ The signature produced by the signing algorithm.

##### meta.security.integrityProtection.publicKey
__Type:__ String  
__Format:__  
__Required:__ No  
__Description:__ The producer of the event may include the relevant public key for convenience, rather than relying a separate key distribution mechanism. Note that this property, along with the rest of the event, is encompassed by the integrity protection offered via __meta.security.integrityProtection__.

#### meta.security.sequenceProtection
__Type:__ Object[]  
__Format:__  
__Required:__ No  
__Description:__ An optional object for enabling verification of intact event sequences in a distributed environment, thereby protecting against data loss, race conditions and replay attacks. It allows event publishers to state the order in which they produce a certain set of events. In other words, it cannot provide any global guarantees as to event sequencing, but rather per-publisher guarantees. Every object in the array represents a named sequence of which this event forms a part. For every event including a given named sequence, the publisher SHALL increment __meta.security.sequenceProtection.position__ by 1. The first event produced in a given named sequence SHALL numbered 1.

##### meta.security.sequenceProtection.sequenceName
__Type:__ String  
__Format:__  
__Required:__ Yes  
__Description:__ The name of the sequence. There MUST not be two identical __meta.security.sequenceProtection.sequenceName__ values in the same event.

##### meta.security.sequenceProtection.position
__Type:__ Integer  
__Format:__  
__Required:__ Yes  
__Description:__ The number of the event within the named sequence.

------------------

<a name="footnote1">1</a>: Event types are versioned independently from one another. There are three important consequences of this. First, any change to __meta__ requires all events to be updated. Second, any schema of a specific version of an event must also include the __meta__ object â€“ specifically as it is defined for that version of the event. Third, consumers should be prepared to receive events of varying __meta__ contents. The exception to this are the __meta.type__ and __meta.version__ fields, which are always assumed to be present change.
