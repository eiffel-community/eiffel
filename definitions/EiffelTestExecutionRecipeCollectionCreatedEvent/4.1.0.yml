_description: |-
  The EiffelTestExecutionRecipeCollectionCreatedEvent declares that a collection of test execution recipes has been created. In order to clarify what that means, several concepts need to be explained.

  Just as Eiffel is an opinionated protocol, EiffelTestExecutionRecipeCollectionCreatedEvent is an opinionated event, and to a certain extent that opinion goes against the grain of traditional test management. This event assumes that activity configurations and test scope definitions are two separate things. To exemplify, when one's CI server triggers the Acceptance Test activity in the pipeline, there is nothing in that activity that says which tests to execute where or with what parameters: that is a separate concern. Instead, it will query a test selection service for that information. This information is encapsulated by the EiffelTestExecutionRecipeCollectionCreatedEvent, which contains all the information needed to configure and execute the tests.

  How the test selection service generates the recipe collection is, from the point of view of the Eiffel protocol, irrelevant. It may very well be from a statically defined list of test cases, or from an elaborate test selection algorithm weighing together a host of factors to determine the optimal set of test cases to execute at any particular time, or a combination of the two.

  The __data__ object consists of two main parts. __data.selectionStrategy__ identifies the strategy used to select the test cases and generate the recipe collection, while __data.batches__ or __data.batchesUri__ contain or reference, respectively, the recipes. The recipes are grouped in batches, which are used to control the order of execution of test cases. Every batch has a priority to let the test executor order them in sequence, but within each batch no assumptions are made as to the execution order the test cases. This way the recipe collection can either allow the executor a high degree of freedom in scheduling the test executions, and/or prescribe the exact sequential order in which they must be executed. Each event SHALL include one and only one of __data.batches__ and __data.batchesUri__.

  Finally, each recipe (__data.batches.recipes__) consists of two parts: the test case to execute, and the constraints of that execution. The EiffelTestExecutionRecipeCollectionCreatedEvent does not control the syntax of these constraints, as the nature of such constraints are highly dependent on technology domain and test execution framework. That being said, there are three questions that typically need to be answered: what is the item under test, in what kind of environment is it to be tested, and what are the test parameters? Note the distinction between test case and test execution: it is perfectly legal for a single test case to appear multiple times within the same EiffelTestExecutionRecipeCollectionCreatedEvent, but (presumably) with different constraints.

                      Note that this is different from the id of a
                      test case, in two ways. First, a test case is
                      a (presumably) persistent entity, whereas an
                      execution is transient in nature. Second, a test
                      case may be executed any number of times in any

                same environment, however, this property can be used
                to specify that. It serves as an instruction to the
                test executor to place two executions subsequent to
                one another in the same environment.
