_description: The EiffelActivityCanceledEvent signals that a previously
  triggered activity execution has been canceled _before it has started_.
  This is typically used in queuing situations where a queued execution
  is dequeued. It is recommended that __CAUSE__ links be used to indicate
  the reason.

  ACTIVITY_EXECUTION:
    description: Declares the activity execution that was canceled.
      In other words, [EiffelActivityTriggeredEvent](../eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelActivityTriggeredEvent.md)
      acts as a handle for the activity execution. This differs from
      __CONTEXT__. In __ACTIVITY_EXECUTION__ the source carries information
      pertaining to the target (i.e. the activity started, finished
      or was canceled). In __CONTEXT__, on the other hand, the source
      constitutes a subset of the target (e.g. this test case was executed
      as part of that activity or test suite).

  CAUSE:
    description: While for most events it is recommended that __CAUSE__
      SHOULD not be used in conjunction with __CONTEXT__, EiffelActivityCanceledEvent
      is a special case as it represents a deviation from previous
      intention. Therefore it is recommended that __CAUSE__ always
      be included where applicable.
