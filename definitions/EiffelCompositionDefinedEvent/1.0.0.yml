_description: The EiffelCompositionDefinedEvent declares a composition
  of items (artifacts, sources and other compositions) has been defined,
  typically with the purpose of enabling further downstream artifacts
  to be generated.

        _description: The version of the composition, if any. This
          is in a sense redundant, as relationships between compositions
          can be tracked via the __PREVIOUS_VERSION__ link type, but
          can be used for improved clarity and semantics.

  CAUSE:
    description: 'Identifies a cause of the event occurring. SHOULD
      not be used in conjunction with __CONTEXT__: individual events

  ELEMENT:
    description: Identifies an element and/or sub-composition of this
      composition. The latter is particularly useful for documenting
      large and potentially decentralized compositions, and may be
      used to reduce the need to repeat large compositions in which
