_name: EiffelTestCaseTriggeredEvent
_version: 3.0.0
_abbrev: TCT
_description: |-
  The EiffelTestCaseTriggeredEvent declares that the execution of a test case has been triggered, but not yet started. This can either be declared stand-alone or as part of an activity or test suite, using either a __CAUSE__ or a __CONTEXT__ link type, respectively.

  This event is used to communicate intent, and thereby serves a similar purpose to that of [EiffelActivityTriggeredEvent](./EiffelActivityTriggeredEvent.md). A triggered test case execution is expected to either be started (represented by [EiffelTestCaseStartedEvent](./EiffelTestCaseStartedEvent.md)) or canceled (represented by [EiffelTestCaseCanceledEvent](./EiffelTestCaseCanceledEvent.md)). Consequently, any delay between triggering and execution can be assumed to imply queuing time (e.g. waiting for available test resources) and monitored as such.

                The type of trigger.
                MANUAL signifies that the test case execution was manually triggered.  
                EIFFEL_EVENT signifies that the test case execution was triggered by one or more Eiffel events. These events should be represented via __CAUSE__ links.  
                SOURCE_CHANGE signifies that the test case execution was triggered as a consequence of a detected source change __not__ represented by Eiffel events.  
                TIMER signifies that the test case execution was triggered by a timer.  
                OTHER signifies any other triggering cause.
