_abbrev: ID
_description: The EiffelIssueDefinedEvent declares that an issue has
  been created in some external issue management software. ID is semantically
  similar to
  [EiffelFlowContextDefinedEvent](../eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelFlowContextDefinedEvent.md) and
  [EiffelEnvironmentDefinedEvent](../eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelEnvironmentDefinedEvent.md).

      type:
        _description: The type of issue.
        type: string
        enum:
          - BUG
          - IMPROVEMENT
          - FEATURE
          - WORK_ITEM
          - REQUIREMENT
          - OTHER
      tracker:
        _description: |-
          The name of the issue tracker. This can unfortunately not be
          standardized, and is therefore context sensitive: though some trackers and ALM
          tools are more popular than others, an exhaustive enumeration is impossible,
          particularly when considering company specific internal solutions. Consequently
          one should not rely on the name as the primary method of retrieval, but rather
          __data.uri__. __data.tracker__ together with __data.id__
          is still useful for analysis and traceability, however, as long as it can be
          correctly interpreted.
        type: string
      id:
        _description: |-
          The identity of the issue. This is tracker dependent - most
          trackers have their own issue naming schemes.
        type: string
      uri:
        _description: A URI that links to a document describing the
          issue in depth.
        type: string
      title:
        _description: |-
          A one-line title or summary of the issue. This exists mostly
          for human consumption, as "Implement widget X" is much more meaningful to a
          human when viewing a graph of Eiffel events than "1302". This is not meant
          to be a detailed description, as such information should be accessible by
          following __data.uri__.
