          The identity of the author of the event. This property is intended

          and/or look up the appropriate public key for decrypting the
          __meta.security.integrityProtection.signature__ value and thereby
          verifying author identity and data integrity.

      integrityProtection:
        _description: >-
          An optional object for enabling information integrity protection via
          cryptographic signing. To generate a correct
          __meta.security.integrityProtection__ object:
            1. Generate the entire event, but with the
               __meta.security.integrityProtection.signature__ value set to
               an empty string.
            1. Serialize the event on
               [Canonical JSON Form](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-staykov-hu-json-canonical-form-00).
            1. Generate the signature using the
               __meta.security.integrityProtection.alg__ algorithm.
            1. Set the __meta.security.integrityProtection.signature__ value to
               the resulting signature while maintaining Canonical JSON Form.
          To verify the integrity of the event, the consumer then resets
          __meta.security.integrityProtection.signature__ to an empty string
          and ensures Canonical JSON Form before verifying the signature.

          An optional object for enabling verification of intact event
          sequences in a distributed environment, thereby protecting against
          data loss, race conditions and replay attacks. It allows event
          publishers to state the order in which they produce a certain set
          of events. In other words, it cannot provide any global guarantees
          as to event sequencing, but rather per-publisher guarantees. Every
          object in the array represents a named sequence of which this event
          forms a part. For every event including a given named sequence,
          the publisher SHALL increment
          __meta.security.sequenceProtection.position__ by 1. The first event
          produced in a given named sequence SHALL numbered 1.
