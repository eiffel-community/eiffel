      A description of the source of the event. This object is primarily for
      traceability purposes, and while optional, some form of identification
      of the source is __HIGHLY RECOMMENDED__. It offers multiple methods of
      identifying the source of the event, techniques which may be select from

      authorIdentity:
        _description: >-
          The identity of the author of the event. This property is intended
          to enable the recipient to identify the author of the event contents
          and/or look up the appropriate public key for decrypting the
          __meta.security.integrityProtection.signature__ value and thereby
          verifying author identity and data integrity.

      integrityProtection:
        _description: >-
          An optional object for enabling information integrity protection via
          cryptographic signing. To generate a correct
          __meta.security.integrityProtection__ object:
          
            1. Generate the entire event, but with the
               __meta.security.integrityProtection.signature__ value set to
               an empty string.
            1. Serialize the event on
               [Canonical JSON Form](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-staykov-hu-json-canonical-form-00).
            1. Generate the signature using the
               __meta.security.integrityProtection.alg__ algorithm.
            1. Set the __meta.security.integrityProtection.signature__ value to
               the resulting signature while maintaining Canonical JSON Form.
          To verify the integrity of the event, the consumer then resets
          __meta.security.integrityProtection.signature__ to an empty string
          and ensures Canonical JSON Form before verifying the signature.
        type: object

            _description: >-
              The cryptographic algorithm used to digitally sign the event.
              If no signing is performed, the
              __meta.security.integrityProtection__ SHALL be omitted rather
              than setting __meta.security.integrityProtection.alg__ to "none".

              mechanism. Note that this property, along with the rest of the
              event, is encompassed by the integrity protection offered via

          An optional object for enabling verification of intact event
          sequences in a distributed environment, thereby protecting against
          data loss, race conditions and replay attacks. It allows event
          publishers to state the order in which they produce a certain set
          of events. In other words, it cannot provide any global guarantees
          as to event sequencing, but rather per-publisher guarantees. Every
          object in the array represents a named sequence of which this event
          forms a part. For every event including a given named sequence,
          the publisher SHALL increment
          __meta.security.sequenceProtection.position__ by 1. The first event
          produced in a given named sequence SHALL numbered 1.
