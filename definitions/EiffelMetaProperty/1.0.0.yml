properties:
  id:
    _description: >-
      The unique identity of the event, generated at event creation.

    type: string
    pattern: ^[0-9a-f]{8}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[1-5][0-9a-f]{3}-[89ab][0-9a-f]{3}-[0-9a-f]{12}$
  type:
    _description: >-
      The type of event. This field is required by the recipient of
      the event, as each event type has a specific meaning and a specific
      set of members in the __data__ and __links__ objects.
    _format: An event type name
    type: string
  version:
    _description: >-
      The version of the event type. This field is required by the recipient
      of the event to interpret the contents. Please see
      [Versioning](../eiffel-syntax-and-usage/versioning.md) for more
      information.

    type: string
  time:
    _description: The event creation timestamp.
    _format: Milliseconds since epoch.
    type: integer
  tags:
    _description: >-
      Any tags or keywords associated with the events, for searchability
      purposes.
    _format: Free text
    type: array
    items:
      type: string
  source:
    _description: >-
      A description of the source of the event. This object is primarily for
      traceability purposes, and while optional, some form of identification
      of the source is __HIGHLY RECOMMENDED__. It offers multiple methods of
      identifying the source of the event, techniques which may be select from
      based on the technology domain and needs in any particular use case.
    type: object
    properties:
      domainId:
        _description: >-
          Identifies the
          [domain](../eiffel-syntax-and-usage/glossary.md#domain) that
          produced an event.
        _format: Free text
        type: string
      host:
        _description: The hostname of the event sender.
        _format: Hostname

      name:
        _description: The name of the event sender.
        _format: Free text

      serializer:
        _description: >-
          The [GAV](https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-naming-conventions.html)
          coordinates of the serializer software used to construct the event.
        type: object

          groupId:
            _description: The groupId of the serializer software.

          artifactId:
            _description: The artifactId of the serializer software.

            type: string
          version:
            _description: The version of the serializer software.

      uri:
        _description: The URI of, related to or describing the event sender.
        _format: URI
        type: string
    additionalProperties: false
  security:
    _description: >-
      An optional object for enclosing security related information,
      particularly supporting data integrity. See
      [Security](../eiffel-syntax-and-usage/security.md) for further
      information.
    type: object
    properties:
      sdm:
        _description: >-
          An optional object for properties supporting the
          [Strong Distribution Model](http://www.cryptnet.net/fdp/crypto/strong_distro.html).
          Note that this only addressed the _integrity_ of the Eiffel event,
          not its _confidentiality_ or _availability_.
        type: object
        properties:
          authorIdentity:
            _description: >-
              The identity of the author of the event. This property is
              intended to enable the recipient to look up the appropriate
              public key for decrypting the digest and thereby verifying
              author identity and data integrity. The format of the author
              identity varies depending on the key infrastructure solution
              used. Note that this requires the presence of a Trusted
              Authority (TA) which the recipient can query for the correct
              public key. The identity and location of the TA must never
              be included in the event itself, as this would compromise
              the security of the solution.
            type: string
          encryptedDigest:
            _description: >-
              The encrypted digest. The cryptographic hash function and
              the decryption algorithm to use, similarly to the Trusted
              Authority (TA), must be known to the recipient. Note that
              the digest of the entire event is affected by the value of
              this property. For this reason the input to the hash function
              SHALL be the entire event unaltered in all parts except for
              this property, which SHALL be replaced by an empty string.
            type: string
        required:
          - authorIdentity
          - encryptedDigest
