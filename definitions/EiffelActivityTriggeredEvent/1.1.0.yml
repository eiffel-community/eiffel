  The EiffelActivityTriggeredEvent declares that a certain activity - typically a build, test or analysis activity - has been triggered by some factor. Note that this is crucially different from the activity execution having _started_ (as declared by [EiffelActivityStartedEvent](./EiffelActivityStartedEvent.md)).

  In a situation where execution follows immediately upon triggering these two events should be sent together. Where that is not the case (e.g. due to queuing) the time delta between EiffelActivityTriggeredEvent and EiffelActivityStartedEvent constitutes the queue time.

                The type of trigger.
                MANUAL signifies that the activity was manually triggered.  
                EIFFEL_EVENT signifies that the activity was triggered by one or more Eiffel events. These events should be represented via __CAUSE__ links.  
                SOURCE_CHANGE signifies that the activity was triggered as a consequence of a detected source change __not__ represented by Eiffel events.  
                TIMER signifies that the activity was triggered by a timer.  
                OTHER signifies any other triggering cause.
