  ACTIVITY_EXECUTION:
    description: Declares the activity execution that was started.
      In other words, [EiffelActivityTriggeredEvent](../eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelActivityTriggeredEvent.md)
      acts as a handle for the activity execution. This differs from
      __CONTEXT__. In __ACTIVITY_EXECUTION__ the source carries information
      pertaining to the target (i.e. the activity started, finished
      or was canceled). In __CONTEXT__, on the other hand, the source
      constitutes a subset of the target (e.g. this test case was executed
      as part of that activity or test suite).

      It is instead recommended to let the root event of the context
      declare __CAUSE__.'
