  ACTIVITY_EXECUTION:
    description: Declares the activity execution that was started.
      In other words, [EiffelActivityTriggeredEvent](../eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelActivityTriggeredEvent.md)
      acts as a handle for the activity execution. This differs from
      __CONTEXT__. In __ACTIVITY_EXECUTION__ the source carries information
      pertaining to the target (i.e. the activity started, finished
      or was canceled). In __CONTEXT__, on the other hand, the source
      constitutes a subset of the target (e.g. this test case was executed
      as part of that activity or test suite).

  CAUSE:
    description: 'Identifies a cause of the event occurring. SHOULD
      not be used in conjunction with __CONTEXT__: individual events
      providing __CAUSE__ within a larger context gives rise to ambiguity.
      It is instead recommended to let the root event of the context
      declare __CAUSE__.'
