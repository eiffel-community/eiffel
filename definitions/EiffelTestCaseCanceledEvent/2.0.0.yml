_description: The EiffelTestCaseCanceledEvent declares that a previously
  triggered test case execution (represented by [EiffelTestCaseTriggeredEvent](./EiffelTestCaseTriggeredEvent.md))
  has been canceled _before it has started_. This is typically used
  in queuing situations where a queued execution is dequeued. It is
  recommended that __CAUSE__ links be used to indicate the reason.

  CAUSE:
    description: While for most events it is recommended that __CAUSE__
      SHOULD not be used in conjunction with __CONTEXT__, EiffelTestCaseCanceledEvent
      is a special case as it represents a deviation from previous
      intention. Therefore it is recommended that __CAUSE__ always
      be included where applicable.

  TEST_CASE_EXECUTION:
    description: Identifies the relevant test case execution. In other
      words, [EiffelTestCaseTriggeredEvent](../eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelTestCaseTriggeredEvent.md)
      acts as a handle for a particular test case execution. This differs
      from __CONTEXT__. In __TEST_CASE_EXECUTION__ the source carries
      information pertaining to the target (i.e. the test case execution
      started, finished or was canceled). In __CONTEXT__, on the other
      hand, the source constitutes a subset of the target (e.g. this
      test case was executed as part of that activity or test suite).
