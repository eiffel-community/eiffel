_description: |-
  The EiffelConfidenceLevelModifiedEvent declares that an entity has achieved (or failed to achieve) a certain level of confidence, or in a broader sense to annotate it as being applicable or relevant to a certain case (e.g. fit for release to a certain customer segment or having passed certain criteria. This is particularly useful for promoting various engineering artifacts, such as product revisions, through the continuous integration and delivery pipeline.

  Confidence levels may operate at high or low levels of abstraction - ranging from "smokeTestsOk" to "releasable" or "released" - and they may group other confidence levels of lower abstraction levels. They may also be general or very niched, e.g. "releasable" or "releasableToCustomerX". Confidence levels frequently figure in automated delivery interfaces within a tiered system context: lower level tiers issue an agreed confidence level signaling that a new version is ready for integration in a higher level tier.
