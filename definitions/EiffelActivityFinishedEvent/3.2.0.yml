_description: The EiffelActivityFinishedEvent declares that a previously
  started activity (declared by [EiffelActivityTriggeredEvent](./EiffelActivityTriggeredEvent.md)
  followed by [EiffelActivityStartedEvent](./EiffelActivityStartedEvent.md))

              A terse standardized conclusion of the activity, designed to be machine readable.
              SUCCESSFUL signifies that the activity was concluded and the outcome matched expectations.  
              UNSUCCESSFUL signifies that the activity was concluded, but the outcome did not match expectations. To exemplify, a compilation job was successfully invoked, but compilation failed.  
              FAILED signifies that the activity could not be successfully executed. To exemplify, a compilation could not be invoked, e.g. due to misconfiguration or environment issues.  
              ABORTED signifies that the activity was aborted before it could be concluded.  
              TIMED_OUT signifies that the activity did not conclude within the allowed time frame.  
              INCONCLUSIVE signifies that the outcome of the activity could not be determined.

  ACTIVITY_EXECUTION:
    description: Declares the activity execution that was finished.
      In other words, [EiffelActivityTriggeredEvent](../eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelActivityTriggeredEvent.md)
      acts as a handle for the activity execution. This differs from
      __CONTEXT__. In __ACTIVITY_EXECUTION__ the source carries information
      pertaining to the target (i.e. the activity started, finished
      or was canceled). In __CONTEXT__, on the other hand, the source
      constitutes a subset of the target (e.g. this test case was executed
      as part of that activity or test suite).

      declare __CAUSE__.'
