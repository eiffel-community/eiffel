_description: The EiffelIssueVerifiedEvent declares that an issue,
  typically a requirement, has been verified by some means. It is different
  from [EiffelTestCaseFinishedEvent](./EiffelTestCaseFinishedEvent.md)
  in that multiple test case executions may serve as the basis for
  a single verification or, conversely, multiple issues may be verified
  based on a single test case execution.

                is impossible, particularly when considering company
                specific internal solutions. Consequently one should
                not rely on the name as the primary method of retrieval,
                but rather __data.issues.uri__. __data.issues.tracker__
