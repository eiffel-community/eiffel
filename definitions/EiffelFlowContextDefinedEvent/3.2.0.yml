_name: EiffelFlowContextDefinedEvent
_version: 3.2.0
_abbrev: FCD
_description: |-
  The EiffelFlowContextDefinedEvent describes the context of other events, answering questions such as "Which project is this change part of?" or "Which track does this artifact belong to?". In this way it offers a method of classifying and structuring one's continuous integration and delivery system and thereby facilitating traceability and searchability.

  The nature of the described context can vary. The event consequently offers a high degree of flexibility in its description, and none of its member fields are mandatory. Instead they can picked and mixed to fit the situation.
