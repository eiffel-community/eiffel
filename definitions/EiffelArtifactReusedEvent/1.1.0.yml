_description: |-
  The EiffelArtifactReusedEvent declares that an identified [EiffelArtifactCreatedEvent](./EiffelArtifactCreatedEvent.md) has been _reused_ for an identified [EiffelCompositionDefinedEvent](./EiffelCompositionDefinedEvent.md). This means that it is logically equivalent to an artifact that would have been built from that composition, and can be used for build avoidance (see the [Build Avoidance Usage Example](../usage-examples/build-avoidance.md) for more information).

  The event has no data members, but solely relies on its two required link types __REUSED_ARTIFACT__ and __COMPOSITION__ (see below).
