_name: EiffelSourceChangeSubmittedEvent
_version: 2.0.0
_abbrev: SCS
_description: |-
  The EiffelSourceChangeSubmittedEvent declares that a change has been integrated into to a shared source branch of interest (e.g. "master", "dev" or "mainline") as opposed to a private or local branch. Note that it does not describe what has changed, but instead uses the __CHANGE__ link type to reference [EiffelSourceChangeCreatedEvent](./EiffelSourceChangeCreatedEvent.md).

  Typical use cases for EiffelSourceChangeSubmittedEvent is to signal that a patch has passed code review and been submitted or that a feature/topic/team branch has been merged into the mainline/trunk/master. Where changes are made directly on the mainline, it is recommended to send both [EiffelSourceChangeCreatedEvent](./EiffelSourceChangeCreatedEvent.md) and EiffelSourceChangeSubmittedEvent together for information completeness.

  Even though multiple types of identifiers are available (see below), the event SHOULD include one and SHALL not include more than one; changes to multiple repositories are represented by multiple events.
