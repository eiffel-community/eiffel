_description: The EiffelTestCaseStartedEvent declares that the execution
  of a test case has commenced. This event SHALL be preceded by a [EiffelTestCaseTriggeredEvent](./EiffelTestCaseTriggeredEvent.md),

          other words, once the test case execution has finished there
          is no guarantee that these links are valid. Persistently

  TEST_CASE_EXECUTION:
    description: Identifies the relevant test case execution. In other
      words, [EiffelTestCaseTriggeredEvent](../eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelTestCaseTriggeredEvent.md)
      acts as a handle for a particular test case execution. This differs
      from __CONTEXT__. In __TEST_CASE_EXECUTION__ the source carries
      information pertaining to the target (i.e. the test case execution
      started, finished or was canceled). In __CONTEXT__, on the other
      hand, the source constitutes a subset of the target (e.g. this
      test case was executed as part of that activity or test suite).
