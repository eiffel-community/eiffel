          Defines whether this artifact requires an implementing artifact. This is typically used for interfaces requiring some backend implementation, although the interface does not presume to define _which_ implementation. Implicitly interpreted as "ANY" if undefined.
          NONE signifies that there SHALL no implementations of this artifact. In other words, a composition containing another artifact identifying it in __data.implements__ would be illegal.  
          ANY signifies that there may or may not be implementations of this artifact.  
          EXACTLY_ONE signifies that a legal composition must contain one and only one implementation of this artifact.  
          AT_LEAST_ONE signifies that a legal composition must contain one or more implementations of this artifact.

          version range notation according to [Maven syntax](https://docs.oracle.com/middleware/1212/core/MAVEN/maven_version.htm#MAVEN402)
          to be used for the version component of the package identity.
          Note that the purl specification always requires the version
          component to be percent-encoded.
