        _description: |-
          Defines whether this artifact requires an implementing artifact. This is typically used for interfaces requiring some backend implementation, although the interface does not presume to define _which_ implementation. Implicitly interpreted as "ANY" if undefined.
          NONE signifies that there SHALL no implementations of this artifact. In other words, a composition containing another artifact identifying it in __data.implements__ would be illegal.  
          ANY signifies that there may or may not be implementations of this artifact.  
          EXACTLY_ONE signifies that a legal composition must contain one and only one implementation of this artifact.  
          AT_LEAST_ONE signifies that a legal composition must contain one or more implementations of this artifact.

          entities this artifact depends on. While not included in
          the purl specification itself, the Eiffel protocol allows
          version range notation according to [Maven syntax](https://docs.oracle.com/middleware/1212/core/MAVEN/maven_version.htm#MAVEN402)
          to be used for the version component of the package identity.
          Note that the purl specification always requires the version
          component to be percent-encoded.
