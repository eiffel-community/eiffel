          Defines whether this artifact requires an implementing artifact. This is typically used for interfaces requiring some backend implementation, although the interface does not presume to define _which_ implementation. Implicitly interpreted as "ANY" if undefined.
          NONE signifies that there SHALL no implementations of this artifact. In other words, a composition containing another artifact identifying it in __data.implements__ would be illegal.  
          ANY signifies that there may or may not be implementations of this artifact.  
          EXACTLY_ONE signifies that a legal composition must contain one and only one implementation of this artifact.
