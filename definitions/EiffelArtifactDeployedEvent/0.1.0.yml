_description: The EiffelArtifactDeployedEvent states that a software artifact had been deployed into a specified environment or
  that the configuration of the artifact has been changed.
  The exact meaning of an artifact deployment is implementation-defined. Progressive deployments like e.g. canaries can be described with an EiffelArtifactDeployedEvent every time the deployment advances or a single EiffelArtifactDeployedEvent once the artifact has been fully deployed.
