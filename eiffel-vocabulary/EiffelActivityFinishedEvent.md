# EiffelActivityFinishedEvent (ActF)
The EiffelActivityFinishedEvent declares that a previously started activity (declared by [EiffelActivityTriggeredEvent](./EiffelActivityTriggeredEvent.md) followed by [EiffelActivityStartedEvent](./EiffelActivityStartedEvent.md)) has finished.

## Data Members
### data.outcome
__Type:__ Object  
__Required:__ Yes  
__Description:__ The outcome of the activity.

#### data.outcome.conclusion
__Type:__ String  
__Required:__ Yes  
__Legal values:__ SUCCESSFUL, UNSUCCESSFUL, FAILED, ABORTED, TIMED_OUT, INCONCLUSIVE  
__Description:__ A terse standardized conclusion of the activity, designed to be machine readable.  
SUCCESSFUL signifies that the activity was concluded and the outcome matched expectations.  
UNSUCCESSFUL signifies that the activity was concluded, but the outcome did not match expectations. To exemplify, a compilation job was successfully invoked, but compilation failed.  
FAILED signifies that the activity could not be successfully executed. To exemplify, a compilation could not be invoked, e.g. due to misconfiguration or environment issues.  
ABORTED signifies that the activity was aborted before it could be concluded.  
TIMED_OUT signifies that the activity did not conclude within the allowed time frame.  
INCONCLUSIVE signifies that the outcome of the activity could not be determined.

#### data.outcome.description
__Type:__ String  
__Required:__ No  
__Description:__ A verbose description of the activity outcome, designed to provide human readers with further information.

### data.persistentLogs
__Type:__ Object[]  
__Required:__ No  
__Description:__ An array of persistent log files generated during execution.

#### data.persistentLogs.mediaType
__Type:__ String  
__Required:__ No  
__Description:__ The [media type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_type) of the URI's payload. Can be used to differentiate between various representations of the same log, e.g. text/html for human consumption and text/plain or application/json for the machine-readable form.

#### data.persistentLogs.name
__Type:__ String  
__Required:__ Yes  
__Description:__ The name of the log file.

#### data.persistentLogs.tags
__Type:__ String[]  
__Required:__ No  
__Description:__ Arbitrary tags and keywords that describe this log.

#### data.persistentLogs.uri
__Type:__ String  
__Required:__ Yes  
__Description:__ The URI at which the log can be retrieved.

## Links

This section describes which link types are valid for this event type. For details on how to express the link objects themselves see [The Links Object](../eiffel-syntax-and-usage/the-links-object.md).

### ACTIVITY_EXECUTION
__Required:__ Yes  
__Legal targets:__ [EiffelActivityTriggeredEvent](../eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelActivityTriggeredEvent.md)  
__Multiple allowed:__ No  
__Description:__ Declares the activity execution that was finished. In other words, [EiffelActivityTriggeredEvent](../eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelActivityTriggeredEvent.md) acts as a handle for the activity execution. This differs from __CONTEXT__. In __ACTIVITY_EXECUTION__ the source carries information pertaining to the target (i.e. the activity started, finished or was canceled). In __CONTEXT__, on the other hand, the source constitutes a subset of the target (e.g. this test case was executed as part of that activity or test suite).

### CAUSE
__Required:__ No  
__Legal targets:__ Any  
__Multiple allowed:__ Yes  
__Description:__ Identifies a cause of the event occurring. SHOULD not be used in conjunction with __CONTEXT__: individual events providing __CAUSE__ within a larger context gives rise to ambiguity. It is instead recommended to let the root event of the context declare __CAUSE__.  

### CONTEXT
__Required:__ No  
__Legal targets:__ [EiffelActivityTriggeredEvent](../eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelActivityTriggeredEvent.md),
[EiffelTestSuiteStartedEvent](../eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelTestSuiteStartedEvent.md)  
__Multiple allowed:__ No  
__Description:__ Identifies the activity or test suite of which this event constitutes a part.

### FLOW_CONTEXT
__Required:__ No  
__Legal targets:__ [EiffelFlowContextDefinedEvent](../eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelFlowContextDefinedEvent.md)  
__Multiple allowed:__ Yes  
__Description:__ Identifies the flow context of the event: which is the continuous integration and delivery flow in which this occurred â€“ e.g. which product, project, track or version this is applicable to.
