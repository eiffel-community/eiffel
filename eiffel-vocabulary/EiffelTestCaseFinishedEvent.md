# EiffelTestCaseFinishedEvent (TCF)

The EiffelTestCaseFinishedEvent declares that a previously started test case (declared by [EiffelTestCaseStartedEvent](./EiffelTestCaseStartedEvent.md)) has finished and reports the outcome.

Note that while similar, the __data.outcome__ object is different from that of [EiffelActivityFinishedEvent](./EiffelActivityFinishedEvent.md). The outcome of the test case reports not only the conclusion of the test case execution - whether the test case was successfully executed - but also passes a verdict on the item under test. To highlight this conceptual difference, both __data.outcome.verdict__ and __data.outcome.conclusion__ are included.

Also note that unlike [EiffelTestSuiteFinishedEvent](./EiffelTestSuiteFinishedEvent.md), EiffelTestCaseFinishedEvent must report both __data.outcome.verdict__ and __data.outcome.conclusion__.

## Data Members

### data.outcome
__Type:__ Object  
__Required:__ Yes  
__Description:__ The outcome of the test case.

#### data.outcome.verdict
__Type:__ String  
__Required:__ Yes  
__Legal values:__ PASSED, FAILED, INCONCLUSIVE  
__Description:__ A terse standardized verdict on the item or items under test.
PASSED signifies that the item or items under test successfully passed the test case.  
FAILED signifies that the item or items under test failed to pass the test case.  
INCONCLUSIVE signifies that the verdict of the test case was inconclusive. This SHOULD be the case if __data.outcome.conclusion__ is not __SUCCESSFUL__, but may in combination with a __SUCCESSFUL__ conclusion be used to represent unreliability or flakiness.

#### data.outcome.conclusion
__Type:__ String  
__Required:__ Yes  
__Legal values:__ SUCCESSFUL, FAILED, ABORTED, TIMED_OUT, INCONCLUSIVE  
__Description:__ A terse standardized conclusion of the test case, designed to be machine readable.
SUCCESSFUL signifies that the test case was successfully concluded. Note that this does not imply that the item under test passed the tests.  
FAILED signifies that the test case could not be successfully executed. To exemplify, one or more tests failed to run due to required environments being unavailable.  
ABORTED signifies that the test case was aborted before it could be concluded.  
TIMED_OUT signifies that the test case did not conclude within the allowed time frame.  
INCONCLUSIVE signifies that the outcome of the test case could not be determined.

#### data.outcome.description
__Type:__ String  
__Required:__ No  
__Description:__ A verbose description of the test case outcome, designed to provide human readers with further information.

#### data.outcome.metrics
__Type:__ Object[]  
__Required:__ No  
__Description:__ A list of metrics collected during the test case execution. Note that while complete freedom is allowed in metrics names and value types, it is highly recommended to keep reported metrics concise and consistent. In other words, do not include excessive amounts of data (use __data.persistentLogs__ for that), and avoid unnecessary variations in value names or types over time.

##### data.outcome.metrics.name
__Type:__ String  
__Required:__ Yes  
__Description:__ The metrics name.

##### data.outcome.metrics.value
__Type:__ Any  
__Required:__ Yes  
__Description:__ The metrics value.

### data.persistentLogs
__Type:__ Object[]  
__Required:__ No  
__Description:__ An array of persistent log files generated during execution.

#### data.persistentLogs.mediaType
__Type:__ String  
__Required:__ No  
__Description:__ The [media type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_type) of the URI's payload. Can be used to differentiate between various representations of the same log, e.g. text/html for human consumption and text/plain or application/json for the machine-readable form.

#### data.persistentLogs.name
__Type:__ String  
__Required:__ Yes  
__Description:__ The name of the log file.

#### data.persistentLogs.tags
__Type:__ String[]  
__Required:__ No  
__Description:__ Arbitrary tags and keywords that describe this log.

#### data.persistentLogs.uri
__Type:__ String  
__Required:__ Yes  
__Description:__ The URI at which the log can be retrieved.

## Links

This section describes which link types are valid for this event type. For details on how to express the link objects themselves see [The Links Object](../eiffel-syntax-and-usage/the-links-object.md).

### CAUSE
__Required:__ No  
__Legal targets:__ Any  
__Multiple allowed:__ Yes  
__Description:__ Identifies a cause of the event occurring. SHOULD not be used in conjunction with __CONTEXT__: individual events providing __CAUSE__ within a larger context gives rise to ambiguity. It is instead recommended to let the root event of the context declare __CAUSE__.

### CONTEXT
__Required:__ No  
__Legal targets:__ [EiffelActivityTriggeredEvent](../eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelActivityTriggeredEvent.md), [EiffelTestSuiteStartedEvent](../eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelTestSuiteStartedEvent.md)  
__Multiple allowed:__ No  
__Description:__ Identifies the activity or test suite of which this event constitutes a part.

### FLOW_CONTEXT
__Required:__ No  
__Legal targets:__ [EiffelFlowContextDefinedEvent](../eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelFlowContextDefinedEvent.md)  
__Multiple allowed:__ Yes  
__Description:__ Identifies the flow context of the event: which is the continuous integration and delivery flow in which this occurred â€“ e.g. which product, project, track or version this is applicable to.

### TEST_CASE_EXECUTION
__Required:__ Yes  
__Legal targets:__ [EiffelTestCaseTriggeredEvent](../eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelTestCaseTriggeredEvent.md)  
__Multiple allowed:__ No  
__Description:__ Identifies the relevant test case execution. In other words, [EiffelTestCaseTriggeredEvent](../eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelTestCaseTriggeredEvent.md) acts as a handle for a particular test case execution. This differs from __CONTEXT__. In __TEST_CASE_EXECUTION__ the source carries information pertaining to the target (i.e. the test case execution started, finished or was canceled). In __CONTEXT__, on the other hand, the source constitutes a subset of the target (e.g. this test case was executed as part of that activity or test suite).

## Meta Members

### meta.id

__Format:__ [UUID](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122)  
__Required:__ Yes  
__Description:__ The unique identity of the event, generated at event creation.

### meta.type
__Type:__ String  
__Format:__ An event type name  
__Required:__ Yes  
__Description:__ The type of event. This field is required by the recipient of the event, as each event type has a specific meaning and a specific set of members in the __data__ and __links__ objects.

### meta.version
__Type:__ String  
__Format:__ [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)  
__Required:__ Yes

It offers multiple methods of identifying the source of the event, techniques which may be select from based on the technology domain and needs in any particular use case.

#### meta.source.domainId
__Type:__ String  
__Format:__ Free text  
__Required:__ No

__Description:__ The URI of, related to or describing the event sender.

### meta.security
__Type:__ Object  
__Required:__ No  
__Description:__ An optional object for enclosing security related information, particularly supporting data integrity. See [Security](../eiffel-syntax-and-usage/security.md) for further information.

#### meta.security.authorIdentity
__Type:__ String  
__Format:__ [Distinguished Name](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2253)  
__Required:__ Yes  
__Description:__ The identity of the author of the event. This property is intended to enable the recipient to identify the author of the event contents and/or look up the appropriate public key for decrypting the __meta.security.integrityProtection.signature__ value and thereby verifying author identity and data integrity.

#### meta.security.integrityProtection
__Type:__ Object  
__Required:__ No  
__Description:__ An optional object for enabling information integrity protection via cryptographic signing. To generate a correct __meta.security.integrityProtection__ object:
  1. Generate the entire event, but with the
     __meta.security.integrityProtection.signature__ value set to
     an empty string.
  1. Serialize the event on
     [Canonical JSON Form](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-staykov-hu-json-canonical-form-00).
  1. Generate the signature using the
     __meta.security.integrityProtection.alg__ algorithm.
  1. Set the __meta.security.integrityProtection.signature__ value to
     the resulting signature while maintaining Canonical JSON Form.
To verify the integrity of the event, the consumer then resets __meta.security.integrityProtection.signature__ to an empty string and ensures Canonical JSON Form before verifying the signature.

##### meta.security.integrityProtection.signature

__Required:__ Yes  
__Description:__ The signature produced by the signing algorithm.

##### meta.security.integrityProtection.alg
__Type:__ String  
__Format:__ [A valid JWA RFC 7518 alg parameter value](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7518#section-3.1), excluding "none"    
__Required:__ Yes  
__Description:__ The cryptographic algorithm used to digitally sign the event. If no signing is performed, the __meta.security.integrityProtection__ SHALL be omitted rather than setting __meta.security.integrityProtection.alg__ to "none".

##### meta.security.integrityProtection.publicKey
__Type:__ String  
__Required:__ No  
__Description:__ The producer of the event may include the relevant public key for convenience, rather than relying a separate key distribution mechanism. Note that this property, along with the rest of the event, is encompassed by the integrity protection offered via __meta.security.integrityProtection__.

#### meta.security.sequenceProtection
__Type:__ Object[]  
__Required:__ No  
__Description:__ An optional object for enabling verification of intact event sequences in a distributed environment, thereby protecting against data loss, race conditions and replay attacks. It allows event publishers to state the order in which they produce a certain set of events. In other words, it cannot provide any global guarantees as to event sequencing, but rather per-publisher guarantees. Every object in the array represents a named sequence of which this event forms a part. For every event including a given named sequence, the publisher SHALL increment __meta.security.sequenceProtection.position__ by 1. The first event produced in a given named sequence SHALL numbered 1.

##### meta.security.sequenceProtection.sequenceName
__Type:__ String  
__Required:__ Yes  
__Description:__ The name of the sequence. There MUST not be two identical __meta.security.sequenceProtection.sequenceName__ values in the same event.

##### meta.security.sequenceProtection.position
__Type:__ Integer  
__Required:__ Yes  
__Description:__ The number of the event within the named sequence.

### meta.schemaUri
__Type:__ String  
__Format:__ URI  
__Required:__ No  
__Description:__ A URI pointing at a location from where the schema used when creating this event can be retrieved. It can be used to parse event data for validation and extraction purposes, for example. Note, that the schema on that URI should be considered immutable.
