# EiffelActivityCanceledEvent (ActC)

The EiffelActivityCanceledEvent signals that a previously triggered activity execution has been canceled _before it has started_. This is typically used in queuing situations where a queued execution is dequeued. It is recommended that __CAUSE__ links be used to indicate the reason.

## Data Members

### data.reason
__Type:__ String  
__Required:__ No  
__Description:__ Any human readable information as to the reason for dequeueing.

## Links

This section describes which link types are valid for this event type. For details on how to express the link objects themselves see [The Links Object](../eiffel-syntax-and-usage/the-links-object.md).

### ACTIVITY_EXECUTION
__Required:__ Yes  
__Legal targets:__ [EiffelActivityTriggeredEvent](../eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelActivityTriggeredEvent.md)  
__Multiple allowed:__ No  
__Description:__ Declares the activity execution that was canceled. In other words, [EiffelActivityTriggeredEvent](../eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelActivityTriggeredEvent.md) acts as a handle for the activity execution. This differs from __CONTEXT__. In __ACTIVITY_EXECUTION__ the source carries information pertaining to the target (i.e. the activity started, finished or was canceled). In __CONTEXT__, on the other hand, the source constitutes a subset of the target (e.g. this test case was executed as part of that activity or test suite).

### CAUSE
__Required:__ No  
__Legal targets:__ Any  
__Multiple allowed:__ Yes  
__Description:__ While for most events it is recommended that __CAUSE__ SHOULD not be used in conjunction with __CONTEXT__, EiffelActivityCanceledEvent is a special case as it represents a deviation from previous intention. Therefore it is recommended that __CAUSE__ always be included where applicable.

### CONTEXT
__Required:__ No  
__Legal targets:__ [EiffelActivityTriggeredEvent](../eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelActivityTriggeredEvent.md), [EiffelTestSuiteStartedEvent](../eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelTestSuiteStartedEvent.md)  
__Multiple allowed:__ No  
__Description:__ Identifies the activity or test suite of which this event constitutes a part.

### FLOW_CONTEXT
__Required:__ No  
__Legal targets:__ [EiffelFlowContextDefinedEvent](../eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelFlowContextDefinedEvent.md)  
__Multiple allowed:__ Yes  
__Description:__ Identifies the flow context of the event: which is the continuous integration and delivery flow in which this occurred â€“ e.g. which product, project, track or version this is applicable to.
