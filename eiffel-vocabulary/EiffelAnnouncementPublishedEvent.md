# EiffelAnnouncementPublishedEvent (AnnP)

The EiffelAnnouncementPublishedEvent represents an announcement, technically regarding any topic but typically used to communicate any incidents or status updates regarding the continuous integration and delivery pipeline. This information can then be favorably displayed in visualization and dashboarding applications.

## Data Members

__Required:__ Yes  
__Description:__ The heading of the announcement.

### data.body

## Links

This section describes which link types are valid for this event type. For details on how to express the link objects themselves see [The Links Object](../eiffel-syntax-and-usage/the-links-object.md).

### CAUSE
