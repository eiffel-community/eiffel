# EiffelIssueVerifiedEvent (IV)

The EiffelIssueVerifiedEvent declares that an issue, typically a requirement, has been verified by some means. It is different from [EiffelTestCaseFinishedEvent](./EiffelTestCaseFinishedEvent.md) in that multiple test case executions may serve as the basis for a single verification or, conversely, multiple issues may be verified based on a single test case execution.

EiffelIssueVerifiedEvent has no data members, instead relying on its required link types. While "SUCCESSFUL_ISSUE", "FAILED_ISSUE", and "INCONCLUSIVE_ISSUE" are all marked as not required, at least one link of at least one of these types MUST be present in an EiffelIssueVerifiedEvent.

## Data Members

## Links

This section describes which link types are valid for this event type. For details on how to express the link objects themselves see [The Links Object](../eiffel-syntax-and-usage/the-links-object.md).

### CAUSE
__Required:__ No  
__Legal targets:__ Any  
__Multiple allowed:__ Yes  
__Description:__ Identifies a cause of the event occurring. SHOULD not be used in conjunction with __CONTEXT__: individual events providing __CAUSE__ within a larger context gives rise to ambiguity. It is instead recommended to let the root event of the context declare __CAUSE__.

### CONTEXT
__Required:__ No  
__Legal targets:__ [EiffelActivityTriggeredEvent](../eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelActivityTriggeredEvent.md), [EiffelTestSuiteStartedEvent](../eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelTestSuiteStartedEvent.md)  
__Multiple allowed:__ No  
__Description:__ Identifies the activity or test suite of which this event constitutes a part.

### ENVIRONMENT
__Required:__ No  
__Legal targets:__ [EiffelEnvironmentDefinedEvent](../eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelEnvironmentDefinedEvent.md)  
__Multiple allowed:__ No  
__Description:__ Identifies the environment in which the issue was verified.

### FAILED_ISSUE
__Required:__ No  
__Legal targets:__ [EiffelIssueDefinedEvent](../eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelIssueDefinedEvent.md)  
__Multiple allowed:__ No  
__Description:__ Identifies an issue that has failed verification.

### FLOW_CONTEXT
__Required:__ No  
__Legal targets:__ [EiffelFlowContextDefinedEvent](../eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelFlowContextDefinedEvent.md)  
__Multiple allowed:__ Yes  
__Description:__ Identifies the flow context of the event: which is the continuous integration and delivery flow in which this occurred â€“ e.g. which product, project, track or version this is applicable to.

### INCONCLUSIVE_ISSUE
__Required:__ No  
__Legal targets:__ [EiffelIssueDefinedEvent](../eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelIssueDefinedEvent.md)  
__Multiple allowed:__ No  
__Description:__ Identifies an issue for which this verification was inconclusive.

### IUT
__Required:__ Yes  
__Legal targets:__ [EiffelArtifactCreatedEvent](../eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelArtifactCreatedEvent.md), [EiffelArtifactDeployedEvent](../eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelArtifactDeployedEvent.md), [EiffelCompositionDefinedEvent](../eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelCompositionDefinedEvent.md)  
__Multiple allowed:__ No  
__Description:__ Identifies the Item Under Test; in other words, the entity for which the issue has been verified.

### SUCCESSFUL_ISSUE
__Required:__ No  
__Legal targets:__ [EiffelIssueDefinedEvent](../eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelIssueDefinedEvent.md)  
__Multiple allowed:__ No  
__Description:__ Identifies an issue that has been successfully verified.

### VERIFICATION_BASIS
__Required:__ No  
__Legal targets:__ [EiffelTestCaseFinishedEvent](../eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelTestCaseFinishedEvent.md), [EiffelTestSuiteFinishedEvent](../eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelTestSuiteFinishedEvent.md)  
__Multiple allowed:__ Yes  
__Description:__ Used to declare the basis on which the verification statement(s) of this event have been issued.
