# EiffelActivityTriggeredEvent (ActT)

The EiffelActivityTriggeredEvent declares that a certain activity - typically a build, test or analysis activity - has been triggered by some factor. Note that this is crucially different from the activity execution having _started_ (as declared by [EiffelActivityStartedEvent](./EiffelActivityStartedEvent.md)).

In a situation where execution follows immediately upon triggering these two events should be sent together. Where that is not the case (e.g. due to queuing) the time delta between EiffelActivityTriggeredEvent and EiffelActivityStartedEvent constitutes the queue time.

## Data Members

### data.name
__Type:__ String  
__Required:__ Yes  
__Description:__ The name of the activity. Uniqueness is not required or checked, but is useful.

### data.categories
__Type:__ String[]  
__Required:__ No  
__Description:__ Any categorization of the activity. This can be used to group multiple similar activities for analysis and visualization purposes. Example usage is to label the similar but unique build activities of all the components of system X as "System X Component Build" (whereas the name would be e.g. "System X Component Y Build").

### data.triggers
__Type:__ Object[]  
__Required:__ No  
__Description:__ The circumstances triggering the activity.

#### data.triggers.type
__Type:__ String  
__Required:__ Yes  
__Legal values:__ MANUAL, EIFFEL_EVENT, SOURCE_CHANGE, TIMER, OTHER  
__Description:__ The type of trigger.
MANUAL signifies that the activity was manually triggered.  
EIFFEL_EVENT signifies that the activity was triggered by one or more Eiffel events. These events should be represented via __CAUSE__ links.  
SOURCE_CHANGE signifies that the activity was triggered as a consequence of a detected source change __not__ represented by Eiffel events.  
TIMER signifies that the activity was triggered by a timer.  
OTHER signifies any other triggering cause.

#### data.triggers.description
__Type:__ String  
__Required:__ No  
__Description:__ A description of the trigger.

### data.executionType
__Type:__ String  
__Required:__ No  
__Legal values:__ MANUAL, SEMI_AUTOMATED, AUTOMATED, OTHER  
__Description:__ The type of execution (often related to, but ultimately separate from, __data.triggers.type__).

## Links

This section describes which link types are valid for this event type. For details on how to express the link objects themselves see [The Links Object](../eiffel-syntax-and-usage/the-links-object.md).

### CAUSE

__Legal targets:__ Any  
__Multiple allowed:__ Yes  
__Description:__ Identifies a cause of the event occurring. SHOULD not be used in conjunction with __CONTEXT__: individual events providing __CAUSE__ within a larger context gives rise to ambiguity. It is instead recommended to let the root event of the context declare __CAUSE__.

### CONTEXT
__Required:__ No  
__Legal targets:__ [EiffelActivityTriggeredEvent](../eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelActivityTriggeredEvent.md), [EiffelTestSuiteStartedEvent](../eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelTestSuiteStartedEvent.md)

__Description:__ Identifies the [activity](../eiffel-syntax-and-usage/glossary.md#activity) or test suite of which this event constitutes a part.

### FLOW_CONTEXT
__Required:__ No  
__Legal targets:__ [EiffelFlowContextDefinedEvent](../eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelFlowContextDefinedEvent.md)  
__Multiple allowed:__ Yes  
__Description:__ Identifies the flow context of the event: which is the continuous integration and delivery flow in which this occurred â€“ e.g. which product, project, track or version this is applicable to.

### PRECURSOR
__Required:__ No  
__Legal targets:__ [EiffelActivityTriggeredEvent](../eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelActivityTriggeredEvent.md)

__Format:__ UNIX Epoch time, in milliseconds.  
__Required:__ Yes  
__Description:__ The event creation timestamp.

### meta.tags

__Format:__ Free text  
__Required:__ No  
__Description:__ Any tags or keywords associated with the events, for searchability purposes.

### meta.source
__Type:__ Object  
__Required:__ No  
__Description:__ A description of the source of the event. This object is primarily for traceability purposes, and while optional, some form of identification of the source is __HIGHLY RECOMMENDED__. It offers multiple methods of identifying the source of the event, techniques which may be select from based on the technology domain and needs in any particular use case.

#### meta.source.domainId
__Type:__ String  
__Format:__ Free text  
__Required:__ No  
__Description:__ Identifies the [domain](../eiffel-syntax-and-usage/glossary.md#domain) that produced an event.

#### meta.source.host
__Type:__ String

#### meta.security.authorIdentity
__Type:__ String  
__Format:__ [Distinguished Name](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2253)  
__Required:__ Yes  
__Description:__ The identity of the author of the event. This property is intended to enable the recipient to identify the author of the event contents and/or look up the appropriate public key for decrypting the __meta.security.integrityProtection.signature__ value and thereby verifying author identity and data integrity.

#### meta.security.integrityProtection
__Type:__ Object  
__Required:__ No  
__Description:__ An optional object for enabling information integrity protection via cryptographic signing. To generate a correct __meta.security.integrityProtection__ object:
  1. Generate the entire event, but with the
     __meta.security.integrityProtection.signature__ value set to
     an empty string.
  1. Serialize the event on
     [Canonical JSON Form](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-staykov-hu-json-canonical-form-00).
  1. Generate the signature using the
     __meta.security.integrityProtection.alg__ algorithm.
  1. Set the __meta.security.integrityProtection.signature__ value to
     the resulting signature while maintaining Canonical JSON Form.
To verify the integrity of the event, the consumer then resets __meta.security.integrityProtection.signature__ to an empty string and ensures Canonical JSON Form before verifying the signature.

##### meta.security.integrityProtection.signature
__Type:__ String  
__Required:__ Yes  
__Description:__ The signature produced by the signing algorithm.

##### meta.security.integrityProtection.alg
__Type:__ String

__Required:__ Yes  
__Description:__ The cryptographic algorithm used to digitally sign the event. If no signing is performed, the __meta.security.integrityProtection__ SHALL be omitted rather than setting __meta.security.integrityProtection.alg__ to "none".

##### meta.security.integrityProtection.publicKey
__Type:__ String  
__Required:__ No  
__Description:__ The producer of the event may include the relevant public key for convenience, rather than relying a separate key distribution mechanism. Note that this property, along with the rest of the event, is encompassed by the integrity protection offered via __meta.security.integrityProtection__.

#### meta.security.sequenceProtection
__Type:__ Object[]  
__Required:__ No  
__Description:__ An optional object for enabling verification of intact event sequences in a distributed environment, thereby protecting against data loss, race conditions and replay attacks. It allows event publishers to state the order in which they produce a certain set of events. In other words, it cannot provide any global guarantees as to event sequencing, but rather per-publisher guarantees. Every object in the array represents a named sequence of which this event forms a part. For every event including a given named sequence, the publisher SHALL increment __meta.security.sequenceProtection.position__ by 1. The first event produced in a given named sequence SHALL numbered 1.

##### meta.security.sequenceProtection.sequenceName
__Type:__ String  
__Required:__ Yes  
__Description:__ The name of the sequence. There MUST not be two identical __meta.security.sequenceProtection.sequenceName__ values in the same event.

##### meta.security.sequenceProtection.position
__Type:__ Integer  
__Required:__ Yes  
__Description:__ The number of the event within the named sequence.

### meta.schemaUri
__Type:__ String  
__Format:__ URI  
__Required:__ No  
__Description:__ A URI pointing at a location from where the schema used when creating this event can be retrieved. It can be used to parse event data for validation and extraction purposes, for example. Note, that the schema on that URI should be considered immutable.
