# EiffelTestSuiteStartedEvent (TSS)

The EiffelTestSuiteStartedEvent declares that the execution of a test suite has started. This can either be declared stand-alone or as part of an activity or other test suite, using either a __CAUSE__ or a __CONTEXT__ link type, respectively.

In Eiffel, a test suite is nothing more or less than a collection of test case executions (see [EiffelTestCaseStartedEvent](./EiffelTestCaseStartedEvent.md)) and/or other test suite executions. The executed test suite may be an ad-hoc transient grouping of test cases that were executed at a particular time or place or for a particular purpose or a persistent entity tracked in a test management system - Eiffel makes no distinction or assumptions either way.

## Data Members

### data.name
__Type:__ String  
__Required:__ Yes  
__Description:__ The name of the test suite. Uniqueness is not required or checked, but is useful.

### data.categories
__Type:__ String[]  
__Required:__ No  
__Description:__ The category or categories of the test suite. This can be used to group multiple similar test suites for analysis and visualization purposes. Example usage is to categorize test suites required before release as "Pre-release tests".

### data.types

__Legal values:__ ACCESSIBILITY, BACKUP_RECOVERY, COMPATIBILITY, CONVERSION, DISASTER_RECOVERY, FUNCTIONAL, INSTALLABILITY, INTEROPERABILITY, LOCALIZATION, MAINTAINABILITY, PERFORMANCE, PORTABILITY, PROCEDURE, RELIABILITY, SECURITY, STABILITY, USABILITY  
__Description:__ The type or types of testing performed by the test suite, as [defined by ISO 29119](http://www.softwaretestingstandard.org).

### data.liveLogs
__Type:__ Object[]  
__Required:__ No  
__Description:__ An array of live log files available during execution. These shall not be presumed to be stored persistently; in other words, once the test suite has finished there is no guarantee that these links are valid. Persistently stored logs shall be (re-)declared by [EiffelTestSuiteFinishedEvent](./EiffelTestSuiteFinishedEvent.md).

#### data.liveLogs.mediaType
__Type:__ String  
__Required:__ No  
__Description:__ The [media type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_type) of the URI's payload. Can be used to differentiate between various representations of the same log, e.g. text/html for human consumption and text/plain or application/json for the machine-readable form.

#### data.liveLogs.name
__Type:__ String  
__Required:__ Yes  
__Description:__ The name of the log file.

#### data.liveLogs.tags
__Type:__ String[]  
__Required:__ No  
__Description:__ Arbitrary tags and keywords that describe this log.

#### data.liveLogs.uri
__Type:__ String

__Description:__ The URI at which the log can be retrieved.

## Links

This section describes which link types are valid for this event type. For details on how to express the link objects themselves see [The Links Object](../eiffel-syntax-and-usage/the-links-object.md).

### CAUSE
__Required:__ No  
__Legal targets:__ Any  
__Multiple allowed:__ Yes  
__Description:__ Identifies a cause of the event occurring. SHOULD not be used in conjunction with __CONTEXT__: individual events providing __CAUSE__ within a larger context gives rise to ambiguity. It is instead recommended to let the root event of the context declare __CAUSE__.

### CONTEXT

### TERC
__Required:__ No  
__Legal targets:__ [EiffelTestExecutionRecipeCollectionCreatedEvent](../eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelTestExecutionRecipeCollectionCreatedEvent.md)  
__Multiple allowed:__ No  
__Description:__ This link signifies that the test suite represented by this event groups all test case executions resulting from the [EiffelTestExecutionRecipeCollectionCreatedEvent](../eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelTestExecutionRecipeCollectionCreatedEvent.md).

__Type:__ String  
__Format:__ [Distinguished Name](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2253)  
__Required:__ Yes  
__Description:__ The identity of the author of the event. This property is intended to enable the recipient to identify the author of the event contents and/or look up the appropriate public key for decrypting the __meta.security.integrityProtection.signature__ value and thereby verifying author identity and data integrity.

#### meta.security.integrityProtection
__Type:__ Object  
__Required:__ No  
__Description:__ An optional object for enabling information integrity protection via cryptographic signing. To generate a correct __meta.security.integrityProtection__ object:
  1. Generate the entire event, but with the
     __meta.security.integrityProtection.signature__ value set to
     an empty string.
  1. Serialize the event on
     [Canonical JSON Form](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-staykov-hu-json-canonical-form-00).
  1. Generate the signature using the
     __meta.security.integrityProtection.alg__ algorithm.
  1. Set the __meta.security.integrityProtection.signature__ value to
     the resulting signature while maintaining Canonical JSON Form.
To verify the integrity of the event, the consumer then resets __meta.security.integrityProtection.signature__ to an empty string and ensures Canonical JSON Form before verifying the signature.

##### meta.security.integrityProtection.signature
__Type:__ String  
__Required:__ Yes  
__Description:__ The signature produced by the signing algorithm.

##### meta.security.integrityProtection.alg
__Type:__ String  
__Format:__ [A valid JWA RFC 7518 alg parameter value](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7518#section-3.1), excluding "none"    
__Required:__ Yes  
__Description:__ The cryptographic algorithm used to digitally sign the event. If no signing is performed, the __meta.security.integrityProtection__ SHALL be omitted rather than setting __meta.security.integrityProtection.alg__ to "none".

##### meta.security.integrityProtection.publicKey
__Type:__ String  
__Required:__ No  
__Description:__ The producer of the event may include the relevant public key for convenience, rather than relying a separate key distribution mechanism. Note that this property, along with the rest of the event, is encompassed by the integrity protection offered via __meta.security.integrityProtection__.

#### meta.security.sequenceProtection
__Type:__ Object[]  
__Required:__ No  
__Description:__ An optional object for enabling verification of intact event sequences in a distributed environment, thereby protecting against data loss, race conditions and replay attacks. It allows event publishers to state the order in which they produce a certain set of events. In other words, it cannot provide any global guarantees as to event sequencing, but rather per-publisher guarantees. Every object in the array represents a named sequence of which this event forms a part. For every event including a given named sequence, the publisher SHALL increment __meta.security.sequenceProtection.position__ by 1. The first event produced in a given named sequence SHALL numbered 1.

##### meta.security.sequenceProtection.sequenceName
__Type:__ String  
__Required:__ Yes  
__Description:__ The name of the sequence. There MUST not be two identical __meta.security.sequenceProtection.sequenceName__ values in the same event.

##### meta.security.sequenceProtection.position
__Type:__ Integer  
__Required:__ Yes  
__Description:__ The number of the event within the named sequence.

### meta.schemaUri
__Type:__ String  
__Format:__ URI  
__Required:__ No  
__Description:__ A URI pointing at a location from where the schema used when creating this event can be retrieved. It can be used to parse event data for validation and extraction purposes, for example. Note, that the schema on that URI should be considered immutable.
