#### data.locations.name
__Type:__ String  
__Required:__ No  
__Description:__ Identifies the name of the file within the artifact for which this location provides the URI. Must correspond to a __data.fileInformation.name__ value in the [EiffelArtifactCreatedEvent](./EiffelArtifactCreatedEvent.md) connected via the __ARTIFACT__ link.

#### data.locations.type
__Type:__ String  
__Required:__ Yes  
__Legal values:__ ARTIFACTORY, NEXUS, PLAIN, OTHER  
__Description:__ The type of location. May be used by (automated) readers to understand the method of retrieval, particularly with regards to authentication.

NEXUS signifies a [Nexus](http://www.sonatype.org/nexus/)  
PLAIN signifies a plain HTTP GET request.

## Links

This section describes which link types are valid for this event type. For details on how to express the link objects themselves see [The Links Object](../eiffel-syntax-and-usage/the-links-object.md).

### ARTIFACT
