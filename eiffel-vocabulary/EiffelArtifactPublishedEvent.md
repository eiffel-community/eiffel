# EiffelArtifactPublishedEvent (ArtP)
The EiffelArtifactPublishedEvent declares that a software artifact (declared by [EiffelArtifactCreatedEvent](./EiffelArtifactCreatedEvent.md)) has been published and is consequently available for retrieval at one or more locations.

## Data Members
### data.locations
__Type:__ Object[]  
__Required:__ Yes  
__Description:__ A list of locations at which the artifact may be retrieved.

#### data.locations.name
__Type:__ String  
__Required:__ No  
__Description:__ Identifies the name of the file within the artifact for which this location provides the URI. Must correspond to a __data.fileInformation.name__ value in the [EiffelArtifactCreatedEvent](./EiffelArtifactCreatedEvent.md) connected via the __ARTIFACT__ link.

#### data.locations.type
__Type:__ String  
__Required:__ Yes  
__Legal values:__ ARTIFACTORY, NEXUS, PLAIN, OTHER  
__Description:__ The type of location. May be used by (automated) readers to understand the method of retrieval, particularly with regards to authentication.  
ARTIFACTORY signifies an [Artifactory](https://www.jfrog.com/artifactory/)  
NEXUS signifies a [Nexus](http://www.sonatype.org/nexus/)  
PLAIN signifies a plain HTTP GET request.  
OTHER signifies other methods of retrieval. Note that using this type likely requires some foreknowledge on part of the reader in order to fetch the artifact.

#### data.locations.uri
__Type:__ String  
__Required:__ Yes  
__Description:__ The URI at which the artifact can be retrieved.

## Links

This section describes which link types are valid for this event type. For details on how to express the link objects themselves see [The Links Object](../eiffel-syntax-and-usage/the-links-object.md).

### ARTIFACT
__Required:__ Yes  
__Legal targets:__ [EiffelArtifactCreatedEvent](../eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelArtifactCreatedEvent.md)  
__Multiple allowed:__ No  
__Description:__ Identifies the artifact that was published.

### CAUSE
__Required:__ No  
__Legal targets:__ Any  
__Multiple allowed:__ Yes  
__Description:__ Identifies a cause of the event occurring. SHOULD not be used in conjunction with __CONTEXT__: individual events providing __CAUSE__ within a larger context gives rise to ambiguity. It is instead recommended to let the root event of the context declare __CAUSE__.  

### CONTEXT
__Required:__ No  
__Legal targets:__ [EiffelActivityTriggeredEvent](../eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelActivityTriggeredEvent.md),
[EiffelTestSuiteStartedEvent](../eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelTestSuiteStartedEvent.md)  
__Multiple allowed:__ No  
__Description:__ Identifies the activity or test suite of which this event constitutes a part.

### FLOW_CONTEXT
__Required:__ No  
__Legal targets:__ [EiffelFlowContextDefinedEvent](../eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelFlowContextDefinedEvent.md)  
__Multiple allowed:__ Yes  
__Description:__ Identifies the flow context of the event: which is the continuous integration and delivery flow in which this occurred â€“ e.g. which product, project, track or version this is applicable to.
