# Confidence Level for a Combination of Hardware and Software

This example shows how to use
[EiffelConfidenceLevelModifiedEvent (CLM)](../eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelConfidenceLevelModifiedEvent.md)
and [EiffelCompositionDefinedEvent (CD)](../eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelCompositionDefinedEvent.md)
for describing confidence over hardware and software artifacts.

## Introduction

Eiffel has the ability to support a continuous integration and delivery pipeline
for hardware products containing software. When developing the software for the
hardware, the designer first runs test specifically for the software part. The
designer then loads the software on the hardware and runs tests with both the
hardware and software. These tests produce the confidence signaled
by [CLM](../eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelConfidenceLevelModifiedEvent.md) event using
the SUBJECT link for pointing to the composition the confidence describes. This
example shows how to describe the combination of software and hardware with
confidence levels.

## Event-by-Event Explanation

### ArtC1

The [EiffelArtifactCreatedEvent (ArtC)](../eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelArtifactCreatedEvent.md)
event represents the software artifact running on the hardware.

### CD1

The [EiffelCompositionDefinedEvent (CD)](../eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelCompositionDefinedEvent.md)
event describes the hardware. The event describes the type of hardware or maybe
a recipe but not a specific device like something having a serial number.
`data.name` describes the hardware or recipe.

### CLM1

The [EiffelConfidenceLevelModifiedEvent (CLM)](../eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelConfidenceLevelModifiedEvent.md)
describes the confidence for the software artifact **ArtC1**. This assumes no
dependencies on hardware when verifying the confidence.

### CD2

The [EiffelCompositionDefinedEvent (CD)](../eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelCompositionDefinedEvent.md)
event describes the combination of hardware type and software.

### CLM2

The [EiffelConfidenceLevelModifiedEvent (CLM)](../eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelConfidenceLevelModifiedEvent.md)
describes the confidence for **CD2** containing both the software and the
hardware type
